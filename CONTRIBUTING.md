## Contributing to this project

First off, thanks for your interest in contributing — contributions are very welcome.

### Ways to contribute

- **Bug reports**: Open an issue describing what went wrong, how to reproduce it, and what you expected to happen.
- **Feature ideas**: Open an issue explaining the use case and why it would be useful.
- **Code contributions**: Open a pull request (PR) that implements a fix or feature.

### Getting started locally

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork and create a new branch for your change:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

3. Install dependencies and run the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Coding guidelines

- **Keep changes focused**: A PR should ideally do one thing (fix a bug, add a feature, improve docs).
- **Match existing style**: Follow the existing patterns in the codebase (TypeScript, React, Vite).
- **Include tests or manual verification steps** when relevant, so reviewers know how you verified the change.

### Opening a pull request

When you open a PR:

- **Describe the change**: Explain what you changed and why.
- **Reference issues**: If your PR fixes an issue, mention it (for example, `Closes #123`).
- **Note any breaking changes**: If behavior changes in a way users should know about, call it out clearly.

### License and attribution
