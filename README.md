## Run Locally

This project reimagines a late-20th-century terminal—glowing phosphor text, chunky borders, and all—but layers it with a modern conversational AI experience. The goal was to capture that nostalgic boot-screen vibe while letting today’s LLM-backed workflows shine, giving developers a playground where retro aesthetics meet contemporary intelligence.
